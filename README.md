# TemplateBot
Its a simplefied JDA discord bot template which is made for starters so they can look around my code and learn by themselfs how JDA bots work.


# Installation
To get it to work you have to go to the https://discord.com/developers/applications website and create an application.

Then there is a tab called "Bot" on the left side when you click on your new Application. There you can change the bots profile picture and name on discord.

Below that is a "token" which you have to but inside the config.properties file where it says "token=".

Then just copy the java classes from this repository into your IDE and run the Main.java.

(If you want to stop the bot just type "stop" in the console and the bot will say that it has gone offline)


# Config
The config.properties file is made so you can easily change the name of the bot and use it as you like.


# Version
It should always be kept up to date and has the latest JDA version.
If not please let me know :)


# Feedback
I would appriciate it that you let me know if there are some errors in the code or if you got something i could have done better inside the code.
