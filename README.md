# TemplateBot

## About
Its a simplefied JDA discord bot template which is made for starters so they can look around my code and learn by themselfs how JDA bots work.



## Installation
To get it to work you have to go to the https://discord.com/developers/applications website and create an application.

Then there is a tab called "Bot" on the left side when you click on your new Application. There you can change the bots profile picture and name on discord.

Below the name of the bot is a "token" which you have to but inside the config.properties file where it says

```bash
  token=[YOUR_BOT_TOKEN]
```

Then just copy the java classes from this repository into your IDE and export the bot.jar file

Finally to execute the file open cmd and type:
```bash
  java -jar [YOUR_FILE_NAME].jar
```

(If you want to stop the bot just type "stop" in the console and the bot will say that it has gone offline)



## Config
In the config.properties file are several variables that are made so you can you can personalize the bot as you like.

## Version
It should always be kept up to date and has the latest JDA version.
If not please let me know :)


## Feedback
I would appriciate it if you let me know if there are some errors in the code or if you got something i could have done better inside the code.

You can reach me on discord @ryfle_
